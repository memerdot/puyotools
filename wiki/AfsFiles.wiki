#summary AFS Archive Format

= Introduction =

AFS is a container for any kind of files, although it usually contains only ADX files. This is a common format that has been used in many non-Puyo Puyo games. 

== Header ==
0x00 - 0x03: 'AFS'
 Magic Code, 4 bytes

0x04 - 0x07
 (4 bytes) Number of files in the AFS archive.

== File Offsets & Length (starting at 0x08) ==
This is repeated for the number of files in the archive.

0x00 - 0x03
 (4 bytes) Offset of the file in the archive.

0x04 - 0x07
 (4 bytes) Size of the file in the archive.

=== Filenames Location ===
This comes directly after the File Offsets & Length Data.

*If the value at 0x00 - 0x03 is 0, this data is stored before the first file.*

0x00 - 0x03
 (4 bytes) Offset where the filenames are located.

0x04 - 0x07
 (4 bytes)  Size of the filename data.

== Filename Data (Stored at the end of the archive) ==
This is repeated for the number of files in the archive.

0x00 - 0x2B
 Filename for the file inside the archive, for the current file number.

0x2C - 0x2F
 (4 bytes) This uses data that is in the header. Assuming X is the current file number, it uses the value that is at:
   `0x04 + (X * 0x04)`
